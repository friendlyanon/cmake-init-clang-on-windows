# clang-on-windows

This project was generated by [cmake-init][1].  
It's heavily stripped down to focus on showing how to use [LLVM Clang][2] on
Windows with Ninja.

You must write a [toolchain file](.github/toolchain/clang-toolchain.cmake) that
sets Clang up to use the MSVC linker, system libraries and system headers, then
[use it](CMakePresets.json#L99) with the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable.

That's it, now you can enjoy having a good compiler even on Windows. ;-)
